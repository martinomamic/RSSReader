An iOS application for reading and managing RSS feeds, built with a focus on clean architecture, testability, and modern iOS development practices. The project is structured as a modular Swift Package with clear separation of concerns.

## Features

- Add, remove and manage RSS feeds 
- View feed items with rich content support (images, descriptions)
- Background refresh and notifications for new items
- Favorite feeds management
- Explore curated feed suggestions
- Add and remove explore feeds to the feed list from the explore feeds tab
- Enhanced feed addition with top recommendations
- Debug panel for notifications and background tasks
- SwiftData persistence
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean, modular architecture

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **[swift-dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies)**: Dependency management
- **[swift-concurrency-extras](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-concurrency-extras)**: Utilities for concurrent code
- **[swift-snapshot-testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing)**: Snapshot testing framework
- **[Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)**: Image downloading and caching

### Development Tools

- **[swift-format](https://github.com/apple/swift-format)**: Code formatting

## Architecture

### Core Components

The project is built as a Swift Package (RSSReaderKit) containing multiple modules:

#### Features
- **FeedListFeature**: Main feed management UI
- **FeedItemsFeature**: Feed items display
- **ExploreFeature**: Feed discovery interface
- **TabBarFeature**: Main navigation structure

#### Repositories
- **FeedRepository**: Handles feed related logic, fetching, parsing and persisting them locally
- **NotificationRepository**: Handles notifications and background refresh coordination

#### Core Services
- **RSSClient**: RSS feed fetching and parsing
- **PersistenceClient**: SwiftData-based storage
- **BackgroundRefreshClient**: Background task scheduling and execution
- **UserNotificationClient**: System notification handling
- **UserDefaultsClient**: UserDefaults interaction

#### Support
- **Common**: Utilities, and constants
- **SharedModels**: Data models used across modules
- **SharedUI**: Shared UI components

### Key Technical Aspects

- **Dependency Injection**: Using [Point-Free's Dependencies](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies)
- **Modern Concurrency**: Leveraging async/await and actors
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracting data sources behind clean interfaces
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI with Observation framework
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and snapshot tests
- **SwiftData**: Native persistence with modern Swift data modeling

## Development

### Requirements
- iOS 17+
- Swift 6+
- Xcode 16+

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make project` to initialize dependencies
3. Open `RSSReader.xcodeproj`
4. Build and run

### Makefile Commands

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile for development tasks:

```bash
make project         # Runs install-tools, setup and open
make renew           # Runs xcode-clean, clean, reset-packages, project
make setup           # Initial project setup
make open            # Open project in Xcode
make init-packages   # Initialize local package dependencies
make reset-packages  # Reset package caches
make lint            # Run SwiftLint
make lint-fix        # Fix SwiftLint violations
make format          # Run swift-format
make clean           # Clean build artifacts
make install-tools   # Install required development tools
make test            # Run tests and display basic test information
```

## Potential Improvements

### Technical Enhancements
- Optimize background task handling and scheduling logic
- Refine `BGTaskScheduler` interaction with a mockable abstraction for improved testability
- Add direct deep linking to articles and specific feeds
- Implement robust HTML content rendering within the app (e.g. for full article views)
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling for feed items lists
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds, tests, and releases
- Enhance code coverage reporting (e.g. integrate with SonarQube or Codecov)
- Add code quality metrics and static analysis beyond SwiftLint
- Implement comprehensive UI tests for key user flows
- Performance profiling and optimization, especially for large numbers of feeds/items
- Add more granular error handling and user feedback for background processes

### Feature Additions
- Feed search and filtering capabilities
- Advanced dark mode optimization and theme customization
- Widget extensions for quick access to new items or favorite feeds
- Share sheet integration for articles
- OPML import/export for feed lists
- Pull-to-refresh gesture for feed lists and item lists
- Unread item tracking and management (mark as read/unread)
- Offline reading mode (caching article content)
- Customizable feed update intervals per feed or globally
- Grouping/categorizing feeds

### Architecture & Development
- Define and implement a formal SwiftData migration strategy
- Integrate crash reporting (e.g., Sentry, Firebase Crashlytics)
- Expand and improve localization support for more languages
- Formalize and unify error presentation to the user across all modules (e.g. show smaller alerts for adding feeds not full screen, etc.)
